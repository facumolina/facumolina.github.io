**Postdoc researcher** \| [Software Engineering and Formal Methods group](https://mfis.dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar) \| University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina.

I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2022 at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), University of CÃ³rdoba. My research focus was the automated generation of formal software specifications, using search-based and learning-based techniques, and I worked under the supervision of Professor [Nazareno Aguirre](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/naguirre/en/Nazareno_Aguirres_Personal_Web_Page/Main.html).

My main [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/) interests are in the area of Software Testing and Analysis, with the goal of improving software reliability and quality. Most of my [publications]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) and tools are available online.
