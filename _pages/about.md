**Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/) - Madrid, Spain.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), where I was advised by Professor [Nazareno Aguirre](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/naguirre/en/Nazareno_Aguirres_Personal_Web_Page/Main.html). My research focus was the automated generation of formal software specifications, using search-based and learning-based techniques.

My main [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/) interests are in the area of Software Testing and Analysis, with the goal of improving software reliability and quality. Most of my [publications]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) and tools are available online.
