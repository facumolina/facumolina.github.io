**Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/) - Madrid, Spain.

I work at IMDEA with [Alessandra Gorla](https://software.imdea.org/~alessandra.gorla/) on software engineering research. My main [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/) interests are in the area of Software Testing and Analysis, with the goal of improving software reliability and quality. Most of my [publications]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) and tools are available online.

In April 2022, I received my Ph.D. at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), University of CÃ³rdoba (UNC), where I was advised by Professor [Nazareno Aguirre](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/naguirre/en/Nazareno_Aguirres_Personal_Web_Page/Main.html). My research focused on the automated generation of test oracles, in the form of class invariants and postconditions. Particulary, I used search-based and learning-based techniques with the goal of obtaining precise oracles. My dissertation is available in the UNC [digital repository](https://rdu.unc.edu.ar/handle/11086/26692).
