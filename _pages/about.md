* I am a [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/)(Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council) funded PhD student at the Software Engineering and Formal Methods Group, at the University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina. 
* My main research topic is the application of machine learning techniques to automatically produce formal software specifications, both from software behaviours and from (possibly partial) specifications in languages different from specific target formal languages. My research involves using a variety of techniques, neural networks and genetic algorithms in particular. The former is being employed, e.g., to learn formal specifications from software behaviours, while the latter to search for declarative specifications equivalent to provided operational ones, and to search for formulas that capture obstacles in formal requirements specifications.
